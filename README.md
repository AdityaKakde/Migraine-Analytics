# Migraine-Analytics
## Problem Setting
Every migraine episode presents with a series of ‘features’ or symptoms. Doctors often use these feature sets to predict the type of migraine the patient is suffering from inorder to prescribe relevant treatment. More often than not, this process of identifying the type of migraine takes a substantial amount of time or often leads to misdiagnosis. The aim of this project is to study the various features that a migraine episode brings along with it and create a classification model using statistical and data mining techniques. The key question that needs to be answered is: Given these set of symptoms, what type of migraine is the patient presenting ?
